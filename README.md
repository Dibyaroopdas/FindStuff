# FindStuff
This is an app built in java that will facilitate easier search for lost items, using QR code and location services
<h1>Functionality</h1>
This app requires a minimum of two users. 
For eg.
User A has some valuable items such as a file of documents.
He creates a qr code in the app using the generate QR code option in the drop down menu
He pastes the qr code on the file, after printing the qr code out.
Let us assume that he lost the item near GandhiNagar, while he stays at NetajiRoad, and both the location are quite far apart.
User B finds the lost item in GandhiNagar and scans it.
As soon as it is scanned, User A gets a notification of where the item is in the form of coordinates.
Once he clicks on it,it opens Google Maps to show the direction of the location from the users current location.
The User can go there and retrieve the item easily.
